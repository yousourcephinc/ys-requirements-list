## **Planning**

- Has a static navigation menu been planned for initial implementation in the frontend?
- Has the menu structure been designed to allow easy modifications and future enhancements?
- Has the menu been prepared to support “role-awareness” for future role-based visibility?
- Has scalability for future additional items and submenus been considered in the design?
- Have security considerations for a static menu (e.g., no direct exposure to vulnerabilities) been reviewed?
- Has a preparation plan for role-based access control (RBAC) integration been created?
- Has the team planned for optimized rendering for fast load times and lightweight transitions?
- Has a UI/UX design plan been followed for responsiveness, visual feedback, and accessibility?
- Are applicable architectural patterns (Component-Based UI, Secure Coding, Scalable Structures) being applied?
## **Documentation**

- Follow standards on setting up sprints, writing user stories, and defining acceptance criteria for the Navigation Menu Module.
- Ensure that all third-party CSS frameworks or libraries used are documented (e.g., Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.).
- Document:
  - The finalized menu structure and all future-proofing design notes.
  - Planned areas for “role-aware” logic even if not yet active.
  - Performance considerations applied in rendering and transition behavior.
  - UI/UX decisions for responsiveness and accessibility compliance.
## **Development**
- Refer to ‣ (placeholder for internal dev documentation link)
## **Testing**
- Refer to Quality Engineers for QA processes.
## **Deployment**

- Has the static navigation menu been deployed and verified in the intended environment?
- Has the deployed menu been tested for responsiveness across different devices and browsers?
- Has accessibility been verified post-deployment (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes)?
- Has performance been validated (render speed, smooth transitions)?
- Has future RBAC logic been marked or stubbed in the deployment (even if inactive)?
- Have deployment notes been documented, including specific implementation details for future maintenance?
- Has rollback planning been prepared in case of frontend issues upon release?
