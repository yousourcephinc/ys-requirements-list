# Planning
- [ ] Which data sources are required, and how can we confirm their accessibility and stability?
- [ ] Which APIs or ETL processes do we need to establish to import the data?
- [ ] How frequently should the data be refreshed to meet stakeholder needs (real-time, hourly, daily)?
- [ ] Which key metrics or KPIs are most critical to include, and who approves them?
- [ ] How will we define or calculate each metric (formulas, data fields, etc.)?
- [ ] Are there performance thresholds or alerts that need to be built into the dashboard?
- [ ] Which visualization types (graphs, tables, charts) are most appropriate for each data set
- [ ] What is our plan for making the dashboard responsive or user-friendly on different devices?
- [ ] Which user roles (admin, viewer, editor) will interact with this dashboard, and what are their specific needs?
- [ ] What volume of data and user traffic do we anticipate, and how do we plan for scalability?
- [ ] What performance benchmarks (e.g., load times) are we targeting, and how will we measure them?
- [ ] **How will we secure a test environment with reliable sample data for validation?**
- [ ] Have we ensured that the dashboard meets any applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, or industry-specific standards)?
- [ ] Onboard stakeholders with the standard requirements for the module
# Documentation (To be updated)
- [ ] Follow standards on setting up sprints, writing user stories and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Refer to Dashboard user stories:
# Development
- [ ] Refer to SE Guides Untitled 
# Testing
- [ ] Refer to QA Guides  Untitled 
# Deployment
- [ ] Develop a plan for deploying the email notification module to production, including rollback procedures
- [ ] Ensure all necessary configurations and environment setups are in place
- [ ] Ensure the client has an account for the third party services for the production environment (accounts to external APIs as data sources)
- [ ] Ensure that all the dashboard required dashboard metrics are present
- [ ] Ensure that all data sources are linked to the production environment
- [ ] Ensure that the dashboard is only accessible by the correct users under the defined user-roles
- [ ] Ensure that the charts/graphs have empty state messages should there be no available data yet
- [ ] Ensure all necessary approvals are obtained
