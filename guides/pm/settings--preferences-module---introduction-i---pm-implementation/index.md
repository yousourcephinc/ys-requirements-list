# **✅ Implementation Guide – Settings and Preferences Module (Introduction 1)**
## **📌 Planning – Checklist (as questions)**
- Have you defined the default behavior for notification preferences (enabled by default, no opt-out)?
- Have you clarified that users can view—but not modify—notification settings in this release?
- Have you confirmed the supported delivery channels (Email, SMS, etc.)?
- Have you verified that no future-toggle logic is accidentally exposed in the UI?
- Have you mapped where notification preferences will be stored and how they will be retrieved?
- Have you coordinated with the backend team to ensure APIs are secure and follow proper authentication?
- Have you reviewed API input/output formats for preference-related endpoints?
- Are you caching notification preferences where applicable to reduce database load?
- Have you validated that the UI responds in real time when settings are loaded?
- Have you ensured the UI design is mobile-responsive and accessible?
- Have you confirmed that users can only access their own preferences?
- Are user inputs (even if limited) being validated and sanitized for potential abuse?
- Is the database query optimized for quick retrieval of preferences per user?
- Have you tested how the system behaves when notification settings cannot be retrieved?
