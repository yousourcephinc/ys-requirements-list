## Module Requirements
## User Flow
## **Design Principles & Best Practices**
  - [ ] **Personalization & Relevance**
    - [ ] Tailor onboarding to user context (role, goals, behavior)
    - [ ] Greet users by name or acknowledge their progress
    - [ ] Use adaptive flows — show only what's relevant
  - [ ] **Cognitive Load Management**
    - [ ] Avoid overloading users with too many options
    - [ ] Group related tasks visually (cards, accordions, or tabs)
    - [ ] Chunk information into digestible segments
  - [ ] **Cross-Channel Consistency**
    - [ ] Maintain brand tone and visuals across web, mobile, and email
    - [ ] Ensure icons, colors, and terminology remain identical
    - [ ] Use consistent messaging hierarchy (headline → benefit → CTA)
  - [ ] **Engagement & Motivation**
    - [ ] Use gamification thoughtfully (badges, streaks, progress milestones)
    - [ ] Highlight user achievements visually
    - [ ] Offer personalized next steps ("Explore analytics" → "Invite teammates")
  - [ ] **Empathy & Emotional Design**
    - [ ] Create conversational onboarding — anticipate user emotions (confusion, excitement, hesitation)
    - [ ] Use encouraging microcopy ("You're doing great")
    - [ ] Include optional guidance, not forced steps
  - [ ] **Transparency & Trust**
    - [ ] Clearly explain data usage or personalization logic ("We're customizing this for you…")
    - [ ] Avoid dark patterns or manipulative CTAs
    - [ ] Provide easy access to help or skip options
  - [ ] **Accessibility & Inclusivity**
    - [ ] Ensure assistive tech compatibility (screen readers, contrast themes)
    - [ ] Offer multilingual options for global audiences
    - [ ] Design for cultural neutrality in visuals and gestures
  - [ ] Build an **adaptive, emotionally intelligent experience** — onboarding that *feels personalized, rewarding, and trustworthy.*
## **Execution Checklist**
  - [ ] **Typical UX Patterns**
  - [ ] Recommended Tools
    - [ ] GrowthBook React SDK – Feature-flag & personalization SDK for React/Next.js (good when building adaptive onboarding flows).
    - [ ] LaunchDarkly React Client SDK – Another advanced feature-flag/personalization tool used for roll-outs and adaptive user experiences.
    - [ ] Algolia Autocomplete JS – Autocomplete/search UI component library, useful if onboarding includes in-app search or knowledge-center integration.
    - [ ] LangChain JS – Library for building AI-assistant flows / retrieval-augmented experiences in web apps (for very advanced onboarding).
    - [ ] Appcues – Full product-onboarding platform (drop-in) rather than just a small library; for big scale adaptive onboarding.
