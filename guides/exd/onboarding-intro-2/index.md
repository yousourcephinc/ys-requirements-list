## Module Requirements
## User Flow
## **Design Principles & Best Practices**
  - [ ] **Flow & Structure**
  - Clearly indicate **where the user is** and **what's next** (use progress markers or breadcrumbs)
  - Offer "Skip" or "Remind me later" options
  - Keep step count short (ideally 3–5 steps)
  - [ ] **Information Density**
  - Use progressive disclosure — reveal more detail as the user explores
  - Avoid text-heavy screens; use visuals or animations instead
  - Maintain whitespace for breathing room
  - [ ] **Consistency & Familiarity**
  - Keep navigation and button placement consistent across steps
  - Maintain uniform illustration or icon style
  - Use consistent typography hierarchy for headings/subheadings
  - [ ] **Visual Engagement**
  - Use friendly illustrations or brand mascots for personality
  - Add micro-animations for transitions (fade-in, slide, bounce subtly)
  - Highlight completed actions visually (checkmarks, progress fill)
  - [ ] **Accessibility & Inclusivity**
  - Use text alternatives for visuals
  - Ensure all interactive steps are reachable via keyboard
  - Avoid relying solely on color for feedback
  - [ ] **Motivation & Feedback**
  - Provide immediate feedback ("You've finished setup!")
  - Celebrate small wins with subtle success animations
  - Encourage continuation with positive reinforcement ("Just one step left!")
  - [ ] Create a **guided, confidence-building experience** that feels progressive — like a short journey rather than a tutorial.
## **Execution Checklist**
  - [ ] **Typical UX Patterns**
  - [ ] Recommended Tools
    - [ ] React Joyride – Library for guided tours / walkthroughs in React apps.
    - [ ] React‑Tippy – A React wrapper around Tippy.js for tooltips/popovers in React apps.
    - [ ] Intro.js – Another user-tour library (alternative to React Joyride) with walkthroughs etc.
