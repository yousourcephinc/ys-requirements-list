## Module Requirements
## User Flow
## **Design Principles & Best Practices**
  - [ ] **Layout & Structure**
    - [ ] Clear visual hierarchy using static templates
    - [ ] Separation of unread vs read notification states
    - [ ] Consistent rendering across notification types
  - [ ] **Visual Design & Branding**
    - [ ] Uses a predefined set of types: Info, Success, Warning, Error
    - [ ] Visual indicators (e.g., color, icon) mapped to type
    - [ ] No custom or dynamic designs—strictly static content
  - [ ] **Usability & Interaction**
    - [ ] Mark as read/unread functionality enabled
    - [ ] Minimal, accessible UI (dropdown or sidebar list)
    - [ ] Relative/Formatted timestamps for clarity (e.g., “5 minutes ago”)
  - [ ] **Responsiveness & Accessibility**
    - [ ] Interface should remain minimal and responsive
    - [ ] All visual states (unread/read) must meet accessibility standards (e.g., color contrast)
    - [ ] Tappable areas must follow accessibility/touch target guidelines
## **Execution Checklist**
  - [ ] In-app notification panel uses minimal, accessible design (dropdown or sidebar layout)
  - [ ] Visual indicators clearly differentiate unread vs read states
  - [ ] Each notification includes a clearly formatted timestamp (e.g., “5 minutes ago”)
  - [ ] Notification types (Info, Success, Warning, Error) are visually distinct via consistent icons and colors
  - [ ] Tappable areas and interaction elements meet touch target and accessibility guidelines
  - [ ] UI components are reusable and mapped to static templates for consistency
  - [ ] No additional links, actions, or metadata clutter the interface—maintains simplicity
  - [ ] Notification list performs well and renders smoothly, even with many items
