## **Design Principles & Best Practices**
## **Execution Checklist**
  - [ ] Users can **choose notification frequency per channel** using dropdowns or segmented controls.
  - [ ] Prototype includes dropdown interactions (open, select, saved, disabled options).
  - [ ] UI allows toggling of **custom notification types** (Critical, Digest, Promotional), with explanations via tooltip or label.
  - [ ] Visual states reflect synced preferences for frequency and custom types (real-time feedback after change).
  - [ ] Advanced error/success states included in the prototype (toasts with specific context, retry states).
  - [ ] Layouts are optimized for both desktop and mobile with clean grouping, collapsible sections, and consistent interaction cues.
