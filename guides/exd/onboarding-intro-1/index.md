## Module Requirements
## User Flow
## **Design Principles & Best Practices**
  - [ ] Present one idea or instruction at a time
  - [ ] Keep microcopy short (max 10–12 words)
  - [ ] Avoid overlapping or multiple pop-ups on one screen
  - [ ] Use color, contrast, or subtle animation to draw attention
  - [ ] Keep tooltip arrows clearly pointing to their targets
  - [ ] Maintain consistent placement (e.g., always bottom-right or top-center)
  - [ ] Match tooltip colors and corner radius with overall brand
  - [ ] Reuse icons and label styles across all hints
  - [ ] Keep spacing consistent between components
  - [ ] Use light, non-intrusive overlays (e.g., soft shadows, semi-transparent background)
  - [ ] Avoid modal stacking; prefer gentle highlights instead
  - [ ] Use readable font size (≥ 14px) and high color contrast
  - [ ] Ensure focus states for keyboard navigation
  - [ ] Limit motion; avoid blinking effects
  - [ ] Use friendly, human tone ("Let's get started!")
  - [ ] Include encouraging feedback ("Nice job completing step 1!")
  - [ ] Guide attention **without overwhelming** the user — onboarding should *feel invisible yet helpful*.

## Examples
  - [ ] **Grammarly** – clean tooltip saying *“Click here to check your tone”*  **Dropbox** – first-login pop-up introducing one key action
  - [ ] **Google Docs** – subtle “New Feature” badge with light highlight  **Notion** – hotspots around new menu items
  - [ ] **Slack** – consistent purple accent and rounded modals  **Airtable** – maintains same tooltip shape across views
  - [ ] **Figma** – transparent modals with soft drop shadows
  - [ ] **Canva** – “Nice work!” tooltip after first design saved
