## Module Requirements
  As a **designer**, it’s essential to determine whether your design requires **third-party API integration** early in the process. This checklist helps assess when and why an integration is needed, ensuring an optimal user experience.
## Execution Checklist
  - [ ] **Understanding User & Business Needs**
    - [ ] Does the design require external data (e.g., weather, stock prices, maps, payment processing)?
    - [ ] Is the business goal dependent on external services (e.g., social login, CRM, analytics)?
    - [ ] Will integrating a third-party save development time and cost instead of building from scratch?
    - [ ] Does the user need to sync data across multiple platforms (e.g., calendars, messaging apps)?
    - [ ] Is there an existing industry-standard API that fulfills the required functionality?
  - [ ] **Identifying Key Functional Dependencies**
    - [ ] Does the feature involve user authentication (e.g., Google, Apple Sign-In, OAuth)?
    - [ ] Does it require real-time updates from external sources (e.g., live sports scores, financial market data)?
    - [ ] Does the system need external payment processing (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, Apple Pay)?
    - [ ] Are users expected to share, import, or export data (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, APIs for exporting reports)?
    - [ ] Does the feature need external communication services (e.g., Twilio for SMS, WhatsApp API for messaging)?
    - [ ] Will the platform require AI, machine learning, or automation features from third-party APIs?
  - [ ] **Data & Security Considerations**
    - [ ] Is the data sensitive or regulated (e.g., financial transactions, medical records, user authentication)?
    - [ ] Are there data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) affecting how information is shared or stored?
    - [ ] Would integrating a third-party reduce security risks (e.g., using Firebase Authentication instead of custom login)?
    - [ ] Will the API provider handle data encryption and compliance, reducing backend effort?
    - [ ] Does the integration require user consent before sharing data (e.g., social login, location tracking)?
  - [ ] **Evaluating Performance & Scalability Needs**
    - [ ] Does the design require frequent external data updates (e.g., weather APIs, news feeds)?
    - [ ] Will using a third-party API improve app performance instead of building from scratch?
    - [ ] Does the integration need caching or rate-limiting strategies to prevent performance issues?
    - [ ] Will integrating a third-party solution help scale the product faster compared to developing in-house?
  - [ ] **User Experience & Workflow Considerations**
    - [ ] Will third-party integration improve user experience (e.g., faster checkout via Google Pay, auto-fill via APIs)?
    - [ ] Does it provide a seamless multi-platform experience (e.g., social logins, multi-device sync)?
    - [ ] Will users expect cross-platform integrations (e.g., logging workouts from a fitness app to Apple Health)?
    - [ ] Can third-party integration reduce friction in the user journey (e.g., Google Maps for address autofill)?
  - [ ] **Competitive Analysis & Industry Standards**
    - [ ] Do competitors already use third-party integrations for key functionalities?
    - [ ] Will integrating an API provide a competitive advantage (e.g., AI-powered recommendations, chatbots)?
    - [ ] Is there an industry-standard API that most similar apps use (e.g., OpenWeather API for weather apps)?
    - [ ] Does integrating with a trusted provider enhance credibility (e.g., verifying transactions with Plaid for banking)?
