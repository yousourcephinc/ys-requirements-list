## **Design Principles & Best Practices**
    (*Aligned with NN/g’s evidence-based menu guidelines*)
### **1. Layout & Structure**
    - Menu is visible on large screens (no hidden hamburger by default)
    - Sidebar Primary navigation
      - Header
      - Body(Menu items)
      - Footer(About, Help, Careers, etc.)
    - Top nav Secondary Navigation
      - Page title
      - Avatar
      - Chat, Notification(optional)
    - Logical menu hierarchy and grouping (e.g., main links vs. submenus)
    - Prioritizes frequently accessed items (top/bottom of menu)
    - Clear separation between menu sections and content areas
    - Sticky header/nav bar is prototyped for long scroll pages
    - Proper spacing and padding between menu items
    - Menu items are grouped meaningfully (visually and semantically)
### **2. Visual Design, Branding & Information Architecture**
    - Brand typography and colors are correctly applied
    - Menu item states (default, hover, active, disabled) are clearly defined
    - Consistent use of icons next to labels (if applicable)
    - Dropdown or submenus have intuitive visual cues (e.g., arrows, carets)
    - Use clear, familiar labels (no jargon)
    - Labels are short (1–3 words) and front-loaded with key terms
    - Menu labels use familiar language based on user mental models
    - Use **visual hierarchy** (e.g., indentation, font size, spacing) to indicate tiers
### **3. Usability & Interaction**
    - Submenus open **on click/tap**, not hover (especially for mobile-first)
    - All menu items have **hover and active states** (even in low-fi)
    - **Submenu indicators** (like arrows or carets) are visible
    - Avoid multi-level dropdown unless testing a mega menu
    - Animations or transitions are subtle and non-distracting
    - Focus state is visually distinct for keyboard users
    - Items are easily scannable (e.g., left-aligned, consistent formatting)
    - Add tooltips or secondary descriptions if necessary for clarity
    - Collapse view on desktop
### **4. Responsiveness & Accessibility**
    - Fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile
    - Mobile includes hamburger or bottom nav pattern
    - Clear contrast between text and background
    - Menu items are at least 48px for touch targets
### **5. Handoff & Design Consistency**
    - Reuses design tokens/variables or styles (no unnecessary overrides)
    - Figma layers and frames are cleanly named and structured
    - Notes and annotations included for conditional/role-aware logic
    - Menu structure is documented for dev handoff and future scaling
## **UI Elements**
  - Primary Nav
    - Brand Logo
    - Menu Items
    - Secondary Menu items(If applicable)
  - Secondary Nav
    - Page title
    - Avatar
    - Chat, Notification(optional)
  - Others
    - Toggle for mobile navigation (hamburger menu)
    - Responsive layout that stacks or collapses appropriately
