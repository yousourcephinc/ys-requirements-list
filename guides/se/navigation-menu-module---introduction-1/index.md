Key focus: Static Menu Item, Role-aware ready
### Functional Requirements
1. Implement a static navigation menu in the frontend.
1. Structure the menu to allow easy modifications and future enhancements.
1. Prepare the navigation menu to be "role-aware," enabling future functionality for showing/hiding menu items based on user roles.
1. Ensure the navigation menu structure supports scalability for additional items and submenus if required.
### Security Requirements
1. Ensure no security vulnerabilities exist in the static menu implementation.
1. Prepare for future role-based access control (RBAC) by structuring menu logic accordingly.
### Performance Requirements
1. Optimize navigation menu rendering to ensure fast load times and smooth interactions.
1. Ensure menu animations and transitions are lightweight and performant.
### Usability Requirements
1. Follow UI and UX best practices for the selected platform (e.g., web, mobile) and CSS framework.
1. Ensure the navigation menu is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
1. Provide clear visual feedback for active and hovered menu items.
1. Ensure accessibility best practices, such as proper keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.
## Applicable Architectural Patterns
- **Component-Based UI Design**: Ensures modularity and ease of updates.
- **Scalable Navigation Structure**: Allows future enhancements like dynamic menu items.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Prepares for future role-based security needs.
