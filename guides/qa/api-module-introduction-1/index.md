## Module Requirements
### 
### **Introduction 1: API Key Authentication & Basic API Endpoints**
   **Functional Requirements**
  - Verify API key-based authentication is implemented correctly.
  - Ensure API keys are required for all protected endpoints.
  - Validate correct handling of valid and invalid API keys.
  - Test API response formats (JSON, XML) for consistency.
  - Ensure basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations function as expected.
   **Security & Authentication**
  - Ensure API keys are securely stored and not exposed in logs or responses.
  - Test revocation and renewal processes for API keys.
  - Validate authentication failures return appropriate error codes (401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden).
  **Performance & Stability**
  - Measure API response times under normal load conditions.
  - Verify API stability with concurrent requests.
  - Test system behavior when API keys are misused or expire.
