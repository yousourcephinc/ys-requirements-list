## Module Requirements
### ** Growth 1: Advanced Security & User Analytics**
**Functional Requirements**
- Verify API access for user data retrieval (secure endpoints for user details).
- Ensure advanced registration analytics capture relevant user activity.
- Validate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for login security.
**Security & Compliance**
- Ensure API data access follows strict security policies (rate limiting, role-based API access).
- Verify MFA flow (SMS/email OTP, authentication apps like Google Authenticator).
- Test security logging and audit trails for user activities.
**Performance & Scalability**
- Load test API access under heavy concurrent user requests.
- Measure response times for authentication with MFA enabled.
- Ensure system handles large-scale user data retrieval efficiently.
