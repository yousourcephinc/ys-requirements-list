## Module Requirements
### **Functional Requirements**
  - Ensure the static menu loads on all supported browsers and platforms.
  - Validate that navigation elements are structured for modular and scalable updates.
  - Confirm responsiveness and correct rendering across screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
  - Ensure intuitive navigation paths and user flow from menu items.
  - Verify consistent menu behavior (hover, click, active states) across devices.
### **Security Requirements**
  - Validate the menu implementation does not expose any vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, open redirects).
  - Confirm secure integration points for future role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Ensure navigation data is not exposed in the DOM or network unnecessarily.
### **Accessibility & UX Standards**
  - Ensure navigation elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
  - Confirm use of semantic HTML for navigation (e.g., , , ).
  - Validate keyboard navigability and focus visibility.
  - Verify screen reader compatibility for all interactive elements.
### **Performance Requirements**
  - Test initial page load time with the menu enabled.
  - Measure impact of menu scripts and styles on overall performance.
  - Validate lazy loading or async loading of non-critical menu assets.
### **Integration Preparedness**
  - Confirm menu structure is compatible with dynamic content injection for RBAC.
  - Ensure modular CSS/JS components can be updated independently.
  - Validate naming conventions and data attributes support future extension.
