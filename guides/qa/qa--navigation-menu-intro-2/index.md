## Module Requirements
### **Functional Requirements**
  - Verify that the navigation menu dynamically adapts across web, mobile, and tablet platforms.
  - Ensure interaction patterns align with UI/UX best practices specific to each device type.
  - Check for a consistent navigation structure and logical layout across different screen sizes.
  - Validate touch responsiveness and gesture interactions on mobile and tablet.
  - Confirm consistent menu states (open/close, active) across all supported devices.
### **Security Requirements**
  - Test that all menu interactions are secure and free from injection vulnerabilities.
  - Validate access restrictions to sensitive links based on user roles or contexts.
  - Ensure that no unnecessary configuration data is exposed in the frontend.
### **Accessibility & UX Standards**
  - Ensure the navigation menu complies with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
  - Check for visible focus indicators and full keyboard navigation support.
  - Validate that contrast ratios and text scaling meet accessibility guidelines.
  - Confirm compatibility with screen readers across multiple devices.
### **Performance Requirements**
  - Verify minimal re-rendering during responsive layout shifts.
  - Optimize and test animations and transitions for both performance and accessibility.
  - Measure and validate load times of menu assets across platforms.
  - Ensure resource usage is optimized and does not impact performance.
### **Cross-Platform Consistency**
  - Check that the design language and visual hierarchy are consistent across devices.
  - Validate accurate rendering of icons, labels, and spacing across screen resolutions.
  - Ensure the menu maintains responsiveness in both landscape and portrait modes.
