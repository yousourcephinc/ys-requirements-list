### **Functional**
  - Check if content from other sources (like tools or services) shows up properly.
  - Confirm that embedded content and FAQs fit the design and do not block any other part of the page.
  - Make sure there's a message or backup content when external content or FAQ fails to load.
### **Security**
  - Confirm users cannot access or change content they are not allowed to.
  - Check that links, embedded tools, and FAQ items cannot be used to break the system.
  - Make sure no private details or settings appear to users who shouldn’t see them.
### **Performance**
  - Check that embedded content and FAQ sections load quickly without freezing the rest of the page.
  - Confirm that old content is not shown after updates unless intended.
### **Accessibility**
  - Use keyboard to test movement through embedded content and FAQs.
  - Check with screen reader if external and FAQ items are read correctly.
  - Make sure users can open and close content without losing their place.
