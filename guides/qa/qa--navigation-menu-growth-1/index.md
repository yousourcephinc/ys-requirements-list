## Module Requirements
### **Functional Requirements**
  - Validate that the navigation menu dynamically adapts based on retrieved user roles.
  - Confirm that role-specific navigation options are accurately rendered.
  - Verify consistent and seamless user experience during role switching.
  - Check that visual feedback (e.g., lock icon, disabled state) is displayed for restricted items.
  - Validate compatibility and stability of navigation with various frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue).
### **Security Requirements**
  - Verify secure retrieval and storage of user roles in client and server contexts.
  - Validate enforcement of role-based access control on both the client and server side.
  - Test for prevention of unauthorized access via URL manipulation or menu bypass.
  - Confirm frontend implementation does not expose role logic or sensitive permission data.
### **Performance Requirements**
  - Measure rendering speed of menu items following login or role change.
  - Validate that caching mechanisms reduce redundant permission checks and API calls.
  - Confirm efficient performance under different role configurations and session states.
  - Assess latency, UI reactivity, and menu update timing under load.
### **Integration & Compatibility**
  - Confirm successful integration of navigation with authentication and authorization systems.
  - Validate dynamic updates based on session lifecycle events (login, logout, token expiry).
  - Check smooth interaction with routing logic and state management within chosen frontend framework.
  - Ensure modularity of the implementation for future extensibility.
