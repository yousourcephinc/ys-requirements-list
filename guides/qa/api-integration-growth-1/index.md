## Module Requirements
### ** Growth 1: Advanced API Versioning, Monitoring & OAuth 2.0 Support**
 **Functional Requirements**
- Ensure **API versioning** supports backward compatibility (e.g., `/v1/`, `/v2/` endpoints).
- Validate **enhanced logging and monitoring** (track API usage, errors, and response times).
- Verify **OAuth 2.0 authentication** for secure API access.
 **Security & Compliance**
- Test OAuth authentication flows (Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Implicit, Password Grant).
- Validate token expiration, renewal, and revocation handling.
- Ensure API monitoring detects anomalies (unexpected errors, spikes in traffic).
**Performance & Scalability**
- Load test API under extreme traffic conditions.
- Verify scalability by simulating concurrent users and API calls.
- Ensure monitoring alerts are triggered for failures or performance degradation.
