## Module Requirements
### **Growth 1: Interactive Charts & Role-Based Access Control**
**Functional Requirements**
- Verify interactive charts allow zooming, panning, hover effects, and drilldowns.
- Ensure charts dynamically update based on user interactions.
- Test real-time data updates and refresh intervals.
- Validate integration of clickable elements leading to detailed reports or insights.
**Security & Access Control**

- Test accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
**Performance & Scalability**
- Load test interactive charts with large datasets.
- Measure API response times for real-time data updates.
- Ensure performance remains stable under multiple concurrent users.
