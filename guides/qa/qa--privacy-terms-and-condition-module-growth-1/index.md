### **Functional**
  - Check if the system shows new versions of the policy when content changes.
  - Confirm users are asked to re-accept when there's an update.
  - Make sure each new version has a clear label (like a date).
  - Confirm the system remembers which version each user agreed to and when.
  - Make sure there's a place where users can see older versions if needed.
### **Security**
  - Try to skip re-accepting the new version—system should stop you.
  - Confirm version details are saved correctly for each user.
  - Check that nothing can be changed or faked from the user side.
### **Performance**
  - Check if updated versions load without delay.
  - Confirm older versions can be viewed smoothly.
### **Accessibility**
  - Make sure the update notice is visible and understandable.
  - Test with keyboard and screen reader to see if users can go through the updated content and confirm again.
