## Module Requirements
### **Introduction 2: Basic Filtering and Sorting**
**Functional Requirements**
- Ensure basic filtering options work correctly (date range, categories, custom filters).
- Verify sorting functions for numerical, alphabetical, and date-based data.
- Validate that filters dynamically update charts and tables.
- Ensure default filters are correctly applied and persist after a page reload.
**Usability & Customization**
- Verify limited customization options, such as color themes and column visibility.
- Ensure users can adjust table layouts, hide/show columns, or modify basic chart settings.
- Check UI consistency when applying filters and sorting.
**Performance & Stability**
- Measure response times when applying filters and sorting.
- Verify the impact of multiple concurrent filter requests on system performance.
- Ensure dashboard does not freeze or crash under heavy filtering operations.
