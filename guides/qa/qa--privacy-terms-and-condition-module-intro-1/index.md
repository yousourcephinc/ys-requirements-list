### **Functional**
  - Check if the Privacy Policy or Terms shows up clearly in a popup when signing up or checking out.
  - Confirm the popup content looks complete and easy to read.
  - Make sure two checkboxes are shown: one for agreeing and one for understanding.
  - Try to submit the form without checking both boxes—it should not go through.
  - Confirm the “last updated” date is shown near the content.
### **Security**
  - Try using browser tools to skip the checkboxes—submission should still be blocked.
  - Check that the content shown doesn’t allow any unwanted popups, scripts, or broken formatting.
  - Confirm the system saves the user’s agreement along with the date and time it was accepted.
### **Performance**
  - Open the popup and see if it loads quickly.
  - Scroll through the content and confirm it works smoothly.
### **Accessibility**
  - Use only the keyboard to move through the popup and checkboxes.
  - Test with screen reader to make sure all content is read clearly.
  - Make sure users can close the popup easily using keyboard or assistive tools.
