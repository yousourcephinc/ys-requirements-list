## Module Requirements
**Growth 1: Webhooks & Event-Driven APIs**
 **Functional Requirements**
- Verify webhook subscription, triggering, and delivery mechanisms.
- Ensure correct handling of webhook event types and payload structures.
- Validate retry mechanisms for failed webhook deliveries.
- Test API event-driven workflows and response times.
 **Security & Data Integrity**
- Ensure webhook endpoints use authentication (HMAC, OAuth, or API keys).
- Validate webhook signature verification to prevent spoofing attacks.
- Ensure webhooks support HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- Test replay attack prevention and webhook expiration policies.
**Scalability & Reliability**
- Load test webhook event processing under high traffic conditions.
- Verify system behavior when multiple webhooks fire simultaneously.
- Test webhook logging and monitoring for event failures.
