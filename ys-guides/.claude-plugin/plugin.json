After it completes, verify auth succeeded by running `gcloud auth print-identity-token --audiences=https://mcp-server-375955300575.us-central1.run.app/mcp`. Tell the user authentication is complete.\n- If you see MISSING_GCLOUD: Tell the user to install the Google Cloud SDK from https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install and restart Claude.\n- If you see MISSING_PYTHON or PYTHON_TOO_OLD: Tell the user to install Python 3.10+ and restart Claude.\n- If you see PIP_INSTALL_FAILED: Tell the user the exact pip install command to run manually.\n- If you see YS_GUIDES_READY: Everything is set up — proceed normally with the user's request.\n\nOnly perform this check once per session. Be brief about it — don't over-explain unless something is wrong."
